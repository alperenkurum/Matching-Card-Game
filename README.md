# Matching-Card-Game
This project is the first project that i made on my first year of university.

In the project you are playing against to the computer. Computer is choosing the card with random funtion and the computer has a memory which is stores the choosen number. Computers memory choosen by the user with difficulty level.
It is realy simple code but i think it is a great project for a starter.


### How to play

When you start the program you see 3 option for a difficulty level. Then you are selecting the cards location. If players find a matching card they gain points and a turn. Who takes the most point wins the game.
